This is the first official release of the CASM project.
It contains a release build of the CASM interpreter application called =casmi=.
For now, we only support =Linux= and ship a statically build =x86_64= compatible 64-bit binary with zero dependencies.
The binary sources are packed and deployed to various environments including ArchLinux AUR and Docker.
