This is the third official release of the CASM project.
It introduces three improvements.
First, we improved our AST language implementation to provide a lossless syntax tree representation.
Build on this implementation feature we are able to construct a source formatting beautifier application called =casmf=.
This application function in the near future as the official CASM formatting application.
Second, another contribution provides 100% coverage of all LSP messages and structures (see =libstdhl=) so that our =casmd= can implement one language feature after the next one. 
Last but not least, we continued with our own =libtptp= implementation to prepare already the next steps for the CASM symbolic execution.
