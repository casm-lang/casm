This is the second official release of the CASM project.
It introduces four big improvements.
First, we added a new language construct to specify invariant conditions through globally defined invariant definitions inside a CASM specification.
Just try it with the shipped  =casmi=.
Second, our huge effort over the summer has finally paid off. Now we are able to compile the CASM project more or less platform independent with various C++ compilers.
Therefore, we support and ship pre-compiled =x86_64= binaries for =Linux=, =Mac=, and =Windows=.
Third, besides the interpreter we ship a new daemon application called =casmd=, which is our own server-sided Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation to interact with LSP (editor) clients.
Last but not least, we publish our own LSP client plug-in extension for the =monaco= editor framework. With this plug-in a fully functional CASM editor environment allows you to specify, debug, and run (execute) the provided CASM specification.
