This is the fourth official release of the CASM project.
It introduces three improvements.
It introduces three improvements and this time all improvements are language related.
First, we have a module and import system for our language. Through a new =import= syntax it is possible to load external specifications and modules into the current specification.
Second, the CASM language allows UTF-8 symbols in comments, string literals, and certain characters for identifier names. 
Last but not least, we changed the =init= definition to be optional in CASM specifications to support =import= only specifications as well.
