This is the fives official release of the CASM project.
It introduces two improvements and all are language related.
The last release introduced a module import concept and we have added a =using= path namespace concept to make symbols visible and shorted their symbol name path.
Besides the =using= path syntax, we support the =local= rule definition now.
This rule allows a specifier to defined (nested) local state functions inside given rule scopes.
