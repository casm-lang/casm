* ImportDefinition

Through the =import= definition it is possible to load external specifications and modules into the specification.
The provided identifier path is used to search inside the specification base path for the requested specification.
If the imported specification does belong to an external module, the import has to be defined externally via a CASM project YAML file.
By default, if no import renaming (=as= identifier) is specified, the last identifier in the given import path is used.
