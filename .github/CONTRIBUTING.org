*** Issues and Pull Requests

The following table contains the definition of the CASM project and organizational issue (=I=) and pull request (=PR=) labels, which are used in the overall project https://github.com/casm-lang/casm, and a sub-set is used in all other CASM sub-project repositories (https://github.com/casm-lang/casmi, https://github.com/casm-lang/libcasm-fe etc.). The =search= link provides a quick lookup to the defined labels and does show all references of such label in the full =casm-lang= namespace. Please keep in mind that some issue and/or pull request labels are defined only for the overall project =casm= and/or the sub-repositories =*casm*= (e.g. =casmi=, =libcasm-fe= etc.).
