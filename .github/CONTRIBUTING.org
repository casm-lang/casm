please use our overall project [[https://github.com/casm-lang/casm/issues][issue tracker]] and
open a [[https://github.com/casm-lang/casm/issues/new][new issue]] there.

To guide you through common issue creation cases, we provided templates 
for [[https://github.com/casm-lang/casm/issues/new?template=bug.md][bug report]], [[https://github.com/casm-lang/casm/issues/new?template=feature.md][feature request]], and [[https://github.com/casm-lang/casm/issues/new?template=question.md][question]] related issues.

** How Can I Contribute?

*** Reporting Bugs

If you have discovered a bug or found an issue in this project, 
even have a question about this project, 
please use our overall project [[https://github.com/casm-lang/casm/issues][issue tracker]] 
open a [[https://github.com/casm-lang/casm/issues/new][new issue]] there and assign the appropriate labels.
A detailed list and description of labels is given below.

*** First Code Contribution

If you want to start your contribution, 
look out for =good first issue= and =help wanted= 
labeled issues in the [[https://github.com/casm-lang/casm/issues][issue tracker]].

*** Pull Requests

<header>[: <short description>] [<emoji>]

[* <detailed description>]
[* see: <links or refs>]
#+end_src

** Additional Notes

*** Issues and Pull Requests

The following table contains the definition of the CASM project and
organizational issue (=I=) and pull request (=PR=) labels, which are
used in the overall [[https://github.com/casm-lang/casm][CASM]] project, and a sub-set is used in all other 
CASM sub-project repositories ([[https://github.com/casm-lang/casmi][casmi]], [[https://github.com/casm-lang/libcasm-fe][libcasm-fe]] etc.). 
The =search= link provides a quick lookup to the defined labels and 
does show all references of such label in the full =casm-lang= namespace.
Please keep in mind that some issue and/or pull request labels are defined
only for the overall /Main Project/ and/or the /Sub Project/ repositories 
(e.g. =casmi=, =libcasm-fe= etc.).
