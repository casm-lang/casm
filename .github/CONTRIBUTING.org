*** Issues and Pull Requests

The following table contains the definition of the CASM project and
organizational issue (=I=) and pull request (=PR=) labels, which are
used in the overall project https://github.com/casm-lang/casm, and
a sub-set is used in all other CASM sub-project repositories
(https://github.com/casm-lang/casmi,
https://github.com/casm-lang/libcasm-fe etc.). 
The =search= link provides a quick lookup to the defined labels and 
does show all references of such label in the full =casm-lang= namespace.
Please keep in mind that some issue and/or pull request labels are defined
only for the overall project =casm= and/or the sub-repositories =*casm*= 
(e.g. =casmi=, =libcasm-fe= etc.).
